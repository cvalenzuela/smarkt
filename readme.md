## Usage

Transform some structured plain text, including markdown and yaml, into JSON, and visa versa. Super useful for archivability and readability.

```js
var smarkt = require('smarkt')

var str = smarkt.parse(`
title: Cyber Mysticism
----
tags:
  - technopastoral
  - dark-ux
----
text: The vectoralist class are the modern day dotcom corporate giants, the transnational turbo-capitalist regime, who own the means of production and thus monopolize abstractions.
`)

var obj = smarkt.stringify({
  title: 'Cyber Mysticism',
  { tags: ['technopastoral', 'dark-ux' ]},
  text: 'The vectoralist class are the modern day dotcom corporate giants, the transnational turbo-capitalist regime, who own the means of production and thus monopolize abstractions.'
})
```

## Structure

A plain-text file is separated into fields delineated by four dashes.

```
----
````

Give the field a name and define itâ€™s value.

```
title: Cyber Mysticism
```

The value can also be YAML.

```
tags:
  - technopastoral
  - dark-ux
```

We won the **battle** and lost the *war*. What Debord called dÃ©tournement became not just an avant-garde but a popular cultural practice. As I wrote in [A Hacker Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hacker_Manifesto): Information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains. It broke free from the commodity form.
